# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors

# Machine Learning Project

This project implements the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using **Markov Chain (4th order) prediction algorithm**.

### How it works

The algorithm keeps track of the last **four moves** made by the opponenet and uses a **transition matrix** (a nested dictionary) to store and analyze patterns.
